```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ (Python 3.11 recommended)
- `uv` (recommended for environment and package management) or `pip` and `venv`
- Internet connection
- API key for your chosen LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Groq, Google Gemini)

### Installation

1.  **Clone or download the project files.**
    If you have git:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

2.  **Set up Python environment.** (Using `uv` is recommended)

    **Using `uv` (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    # Install uv if you haven't already: pip install uv
    uv venv --python 3.11  # Creates a .venv directory
    # Activate environment:
    # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    # On Mac/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

    **Using standard `venv`:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    # On Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies.**
    ```bash
    # Using uv (fastest)
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Or using pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Install Playwright browsers (required for browser automation)
    playwright install
    ```

4.  **Configure environment variables.**
    Copy the example environment file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Edit the `.env` file and add your API key(s) for the desired LLM provider(s). For example:
    ```env
    # For OpenAI
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_sk_key_here

    # For Groq
    GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_gsk_key_here

    # For Google Gemini
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_ai_key_here

    # You can also set a default LLM_PROVIDER (openai, groq, gemini)
    # LLM_PROVIDER=groq
    ```
    The applications (`agent.py` and `chat.py`) will use these keys. The chat interface also allows setting these at runtime.

## üíª Usage

There are two main ways to use this system:

### 1. Command-Line Tracking Agent (`agent.py`)

This is for direct, scripted tracking of booking IDs.

**Using the run scripts (Recommended for CLI):**
   ```bash
   # On Windows:
   run.bat SINI25432400

   # On Mac/Linux (make sure it's executable: chmod +x run.sh):
   ./run.sh SINI25432400
   ```
   The script will guide you if the `.env` file is not configured.

**Direct Python execution (CLI):**
   Make sure your virtual environment is activated and `.env` is configured.
   ```bash
   python agent.py SINI25432400
   # For multiple booking IDs:
   python agent.py SINI25432400 ABCD12345678
   ```

**Expected CLI Output (Example):**
   ```
   üö¢ Starting shipment tracking for booking ID: SINI25432400
   ü§ñ Using Groq (llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct) # Example LLM
   ‚úÖ Successfully retrieved shipping information!

   ==================================================
   TRACKING RESULTS
   ==================================================
   üì¶ Booking ID: SINI25432400
   üö¢ Voyage Number: HMM001E
   üìÖ Arrival Date: 2025-06-15
   üè≠ Vessel Name: HMM COPENHAGEN
   üîÑ Status: In Transit
   ü§ñ LLM Provider: groq

   ‚úÖ Tracking completed!
   ```

### 2. Interactive Chat Application (`chat.py`)

This provides a web-based UI for tracking shipments, configuring LLM providers, and viewing real-time agent logs.

**Running the chat application:**
   Make sure your virtual environment is activated.
   ```bash
   chainlit run chat.py -w
   ```
   The `-w` flag enables auto-reloading when you make changes to `chat.py`.
   Open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided by Chainlit (usually `http://localhost:8000`).

**Using the Chat Application:**
1.  On the first run, or by clicking the settings (‚öôÔ∏è) icon, configure your LLM Provider and API Key.
2.  Type your tracking request into the chat input (e.g., "Track SINI25432400").
3.  Observe the real-time logs and the agent's progress.
4.  Receive a formatted response with the tracking details.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

Beyond API keys, other settings can be configured in the `.env` file (primarily for `agent.py`'s direct use or as defaults):

```env
# Browser settings for agent.py when run directly
BROWSER_HEADLESS=true          # Set to false to see browser window
BROWSER_TIMEOUT=30000          # Timeout in milliseconds
BROWSER_SLOW_MO=100            # Slow down automation for debugging

# Caching for agent.py
CACHE_EXPIRY_HOURS=24          # How long to cache results

# Retry settings for agent.py
MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3           # Number of retry attempts
RETRY_DELAY_SECONDS=5          # Delay between retries

# Debugging for agent.py
ENABLE_SCREENSHOTS=false       # Save screenshots for debugging agent.py
LOG_LEVEL=INFO                 # Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) for agent.py
LOG_FILE=shipping_tracking.log # Log file for agent.py direct runs
```
The `chat.py` application has its own logging and settings UI for some of these.

## üîß Advanced Usage & Customization

### Batch Processing with `agent.py`

You can script `agent.py` for batch processing multiple booking IDs. Refer to the `agent.py`'s `main()` function or create a custom script that imports `ShippingTrackingAgent`.

### Supporting Different Booking IDs / Shipping Lines

- **Booking IDs**: The AI agent is designed to be flexible. The prompts in `agent.py` can be adjusted to better guide the AI for specific ID formats or websites.
- **Shipping Lines**: To support new shipping lines:
    1.  Update the AI prompts in `agent.py` (e.g., `tracking_prompt`) to include instructions for the new line/website.
    2.  The `Config` class (`config.py`) could be extended if specific URLs or patterns for new lines need to be managed systemically, though the current approach relies more on AI flexibility.

## üß™ Output Verification

1.  **Console Output (CLI)**: Real-time status updates and results from `agent.py`.
2.  **Chat Interface (UI)**: Formatted responses and detailed tracking results viewable in the UI.
3.  **Real-time Logs (UI)**: The chat interface streams logs from the agent.
4.  **Database Storage (`shipping_tracking.db`)**: `agent.py` can cache results.
5.  **Screenshots**: If `ENABLE_SCREENSHOTS=true` in `.env`, `agent.py` may save screenshots in a `screenshots/` directory during debugging.
6.  **Log File**: For CLI runs of `agent.py`, logs are stored in `shipping_tracking.log` (or as configured).

## üîÑ Adaptability and Generalization

The system's adaptability relies on:
- **LLM Capabilities**: The core of understanding and navigating websites is handled by the LLM.
- **Flexible Prompts**: The prompts given to the AI in `agent.py` are crucial. They guide the AI without hardcoding specific steps.
- **Browser Automation Tools**: `browser_use` library abstracts many browser interaction complexities.
- **Error Handling and Fallbacks**: `agent.py` includes logic for retries and potential fallback strategies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1.  **API Key Not Found/Invalid**:
    *   Ensure your `.env` file is correctly formatted and contains the valid API key for the selected LLM provider.
    *   In the chat app, double-check the API key entered in the settings panel.
    *   Verify the environment variable name matches what the application expects (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`).

2.  **"Browser launch failed" / Playwright Issues**:
    *   Ensure Playwright browsers are installed: `playwright install`.
    *   Try running with `BROWSER_HEADLESS=false` (in `.env` for `agent.py`) to see if the browser window provides more clues.

3.  **"No tracking results found" / AI Agent Issues**:
    *   The target website might have changed. Try adjusting the prompt in `agent.py` (`tracking_prompt`).
    *   The booking ID might be invalid or not in the system.
    *   Check `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` in `.env` for more detailed logs from `agent.py`.
    *   In the chat app, enable "Show Real-time Agent Logs" for insights.

4.  **Module Not Found Errors**:
    *   Ensure your virtual environment is activated.
    *   Reinstall dependencies: `uv pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

5.  **Chainlit App Not Starting / UI Issues**:
    *   Check the terminal output when you run `chainlit run chat.py -w` for any error messages.
    *   Ensure Chainlit is installed correctly in your virtual environment.
    *   Try accessing in a different browser or incognito mode.

### Debug Mode

- **For `agent.py` (CLI)**:
  Set in `.env`: `BROWSER_HEADLESS=false`, `ENABLE_SCREENSHOTS=true`, `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`.
- **For `chat.py` (UI)**:
  Use the "Show Real-time Agent Logs" switch in the chat settings. Examine terminal output from `chainlit run ...`.
